# **DSE511_Project: Predicting NFL Win Totals**

## **Problem Statement**  
This project investigates whether the number of wins an NFL team achieves in a season can be predicted before the season starts. Using historical team statistics and preseason win total betting lines, we aim to build a predictive model with potential applications in sports analytics and betting.

## **Data**  
The dataset includes:  
- Historical NFL team statistics and preseason betting lines from the 2021, 2022, and 2023 seasons.

## **Approach**  
1. **Web Scraping in R**:  
   Extract NFL team statistics and preseason betting data from CBS Sports for multiple seasons.  
2. **Data Processing and Analysis in Python**:  
   Use Python for detailed analysis and generating visual insights to support the predictive models.  
3. **Predictive Modeling in R**:  
   Build models to predict NFL team win totals using statistical and machine learning techniques.  
4. **Documentation and Visualization**:  
   Integrate findings into clear reports and use Python visualizations to illustrate trends and predictions.  

## **Tools**  
- **R**: Web scraping, data preparation, and model development using `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`.  
- **Python**: Data visualization for detailed graphical representations of results and trends.
