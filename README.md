## Problem Statement
This project explores whether the number of wins an NFL team achieves in a season can be predicted before the season starts. The analysis uses historical team statistics and preseason win total betting lines to build a predictive model, with potential applications in sports betting.

## Data
The dataset includes:
- Historical team statistics from 2021-2023 NFL seasons.
- Preseason win total betting lines.

## Approach
1. Use **R** to scrape NFL statistics and betting data from web sources.
2. Process and analyze the data using **Python**.
3. Build predictive models in R and visualize the results.
4. Document findings and predictions.

## Tools
- **R**: For web scraping, data preparation and modeling
- **Python**: For analysis and visualization
